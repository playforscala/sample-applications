Play for Scala Sample Applications
==================================

This repository contains the sample applications for **[Play for Scala](http://bit.ly/playscala)**.

The book
--------

The book [Play for Scala](http://bit.ly/playscala) is published by Manning, and currently available for early access. All chapters are written, so if you buy it now you'll receive all 10 chapters as an e-book or PDF and the final improved and copy-editted version as soon as it's ready.

The samples
-----------

This is a work in progress, we're currently busy finishing and uploading the sample applications for the remaining chapters.

All applications are updated for *Play 2.1.3*, and have an index page that shows links to the pages that demo the features of that application.

There is a separate branch *play-2.0* with older samples for Play 2.0.4.
